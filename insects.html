                            <h4>Identifying marks:</h4>
                            Adults are 2.5-3.0 mm long, brown, winged,
                            or without wings. The legs are hairless and
                            the hind leg has a large, mobile outgrowth.</p>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Damage:</h4>
                            Adults and nymphs cause direct damage
                            by sucking the sap at the base of the tillers.
                            Plants turn yellow and dry up rapidly.
                            Heavy infestation creates brown patches
                            of dried plants known as hopperburn. They
                            also transmit virus diseases: ragged stunt,
                            grassy stunt, and wilted stunt. Excreted
                            honeydew on infested plants may also
                            become a medium for sooty mold fungus.
                            Life cycle:
                            Eggs are laid in batches inside the leaf
                            sheaths and on the leaf midrib. Nymphs
                            are brown. Nymphs molt five times before
                            turning to adult. Adults with long wings are
                            attracted to light traps.</p>

                            They are slender insects, usually narrowing at
                            the back. They have thin tapering antennae.
                            The hind legs are covered with hairs. Adults
                            are 3.2-5.3 mm long, opaque green, with
                            black markings on the head, face, wings, and
                            wing tips</p>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Damage:</h4>
                            Adults and nymphs cause direct damage to
                            the rice plant by sucking the sap from leaf
                            sheaths and leaf blades. They also cause
                            indirect damage by injecting toxic chemicals
                            and transmitting viruses (tungro, dwarf,
                            transitory yellowing, and yellow-orange leaf)
                            and a mycoplasma disease (yellow dwarf).
                            They mostly confine themselves and feed
                            on the leaf and leaf sheath of rice. Mild
                            infestations reduce plant vigor and number
                            of productive tillers. Heavy infestations cause
                            withering and complete drying of the crop.</p>

                            <h4>Identifying marks:</h4>
                            The adult moth is fawn-colored with brown
                            streaks on the forewings and white hindwings.
                            There is a cluster of hairs on the neck. The
                            wingspan of female moths is 30-35 mm. The
                            male and female moths can be distinguished by
                            their antennae; they are comblike in the male
                            and threadlike in the female. The males are
                            smaller than the females. The larva is purplish
                            pink on the back and white on the abdomen.
                            The head capsule is orange-red. The body is
                            distinctly segmented with no stripes, and tapers
                            toward the abdominal tips. Larvae are found at
                            ground level inside the stem. The eggs are beadlike, and laid in rows within the leaf
                            sheath and
                            the stem. They are creamy white to dark and are
                            not covered with hairs.</p>

                            <h4>Damage:</h4>
                            Young plants typically show deadheart
                            symptoms. The older plants have extensive
                            parts of the stem hollowed out, with
                            consequent physical weakening of the stem and
                            a reduction of crop yield. </p>

                            The adult of this species looks similar to the
                            YSB except that it does not have any dark
                            spot on the forewings, in either sex. Hence,
                            the white stem borer (WSB) sexes look similar.
                            Orange hairs are present at the end of the
                            female white stem borer’s abdomen, while
                            in yellow stem borer they are yellowish. The
                            wingspan of the adult female is 26-30 mm,
                            with males being smaller.</p>

                            The larvae bore into the rice stems and hollow out the stem nodes and
                            internodes. Young plants exhibit deadhearts while older plants develop
                            whiteheads. Older plants often break where the stem is hollowed out
                            causing lodging.</p>

                            The male and female adults are two different forms, and with distinct sexual
                            characteristics. The female moth has one dark spot at the center of its
                            bright yellowish forewings, while spots on the forewings of the male are
                            not clearly seen. The wingspan is 22–30 mm. The males are smaller than
                            the females, and do not have yellowish hairs at the end of the abdomen. </p>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Damage:</h4>
                            The larvae bore into the rice stems and hollow out the stem completely. In
                            young plants, the central leaf whorl does not unfold, turns brownish, and
                            dries up, although lower leaves remain green and healthy. Such symptom
                            is referred to as deadheart. In older plants, the panicles dry up with unfilled
                            grains and turn white. Such symptom is referred to as whitehead. Both
                            deadheart and whitehead can easily be pulled out by hand. Older plants
                            often break where the stem was hollowed out causing lodging. </p>

                            <h1>Yellow Stem Borer</h1>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Identifying marks:</h4>
                            The male and female adults are two different forms, and with distinct sexual
                            characteristics. The female moth has one dark spot at the center of its
                            bright yellowish forewings, while spots on the forewings of the male are
                            not clearly seen. The wingspan is 22–30 mm. The males are smaller than
                            the females, and do not have yellowish hairs at the end of the abdomen. </p>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Damage:</h4>
                            The larvae bore into the rice stems and hollow out the stem completely. In
                            young plants, the central leaf whorl does not unfold, turns brownish, and
                            dries up, although lower leaves remain green and healthy. Such symptom
                            is referred to as deadheart. In older plants, the panicles dry up with unfilled
                            grains and turn white. Such symptom is referred to as whitehead. Both
                            deadheart and whitehead can easily be pulled out by hand. Older plants
                            often break where the stem was hollowed out causing lodging. </p>

                            <p>
                            <h4>Identifying marks:</h4>
                            The adult moth has dark purplish brown
                            forewings with numerous spots and lightcolored lines. The hind wings are whitish,
                            narrowly banded along the outer margin.
                            The wingspan is about 30 mm. Larvae are
                            soil-dwelling or hide underground to avoid
                            predation by birds. They become active at
                            night and emerge from the ground. Larvae
                            come in various colors, ranging from creamy
                            white to green or dark purple, with or without
                            stripes.</p>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Damage:</h4>
                            Larva is the damaging stage.
                            Young rice plants are often
                            cut at ground level while older
                            plants are only defoliated. Newly
                            hatched larvae usually feed
                            together on the leaf surface. The
                            older larvae are night-feeders
                            and are usually found in the soil
                            around the base of the plants.
                            Susceptible growth stages are
                            from seedling to ripening. </p>

                            <h4>Identifying marks:</h4>
                            They are slender, small insects, usually tapering posteriorly with thin
                            tapering antennae. They jump readily when disturbed. The hind legs are
                            covered with hairs. They have white forewings with pale brown bands
                            forming the shape of a W giving the zigzagged pattern. They can be found
                            either on leaves in the upper parts of the rice plant or on tillers near the
                            base.</p>
                            <p>
                            <h4>Damage:</h4>
                            Adults and nymphs cause direct damage by removing sap from young rice
                            leaves. They also transmit orange leaf, tungro, and dwarf viruses. Leaf tips
                            dry and leaf margins become orange. Later, the entire leaf becomes orange
                            and leaf margins curl. Damage appears first on older leaves. Nymphs and
                            adults excrete honeydew, which causes sooty molds.</p>

                            extending posteriorly along the wings. The antennae are short, much less
                            than the length of the body. When in swarms, they are in their migratory
                            phase and are called locusts.</p>

                            Grasshoppers can damage rice at all
                            stages of crop growth. Nymphs eat
                            newly germinated rice seedlings and
                            cause them to wither. Adults feed on
                            the leaves and shoots, and may eat the
                            base of the panicle causing it to wither
                            and die.
                            If the emerging flowers are attacked,
                            the resulting grains become chaffy.
                            Swarming locusts can remove most of
                            the foliage in a rice field leaving only the
                            base of tillers.</p>
